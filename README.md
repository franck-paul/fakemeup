Dotclear 2 plugin

## Purpose

This plugin is indented to bypass error messages displayed when trying to upgrade dotclear whereas some core files have been altered.

Before proceeding, you must take into consideration that any core file you may have modified will be overwritten by the new ones when you perform an upgrade. Any custom change will then be lost!
